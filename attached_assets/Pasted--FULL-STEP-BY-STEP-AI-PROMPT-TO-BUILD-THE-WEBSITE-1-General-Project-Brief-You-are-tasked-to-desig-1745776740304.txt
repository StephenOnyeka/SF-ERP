üî• FULL STEP-BY-STEP AI PROMPT TO BUILD THE WEBSITE
1. General Project Brief
You are tasked to design and build a modern, beautiful, professional ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) web application called Sforger ERP.
This application will focus on employee management, attendance, leave tracking, payroll, analytics, and HR operations.

2. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js (with TailwindCSS for styling)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with role-based access control

Hosting: Deploy on Vercel (frontend) and Railway.app (backend)

3. UI/UX Design Guidelines:

Color Scheme: White background, Blue primary accents, Soft Grey backgrounds for cards, Black text.

Typography: Use Inter or Roboto font family.

Components:

Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)

Light shadows (shadow-md)

Smooth animations (transition-all duration-300)

Icons: Use Lucide Icons or Heroicons for a professional look.

Mobile Responsive: All pages must be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

4. Pages and Functional Requirements:


Page	Functions Needed
/login	Secure login for Admin, HR, Employees
/dashboard	Show personalized details (Employee Name, Role, Dept), real-time clock-in/out buttons, leave balance.
/attendance	Show timestamps of clock-in/clock-out, missed punches alerts, half-day markings.
/leave-management	Apply for leave, see leave types (PL, SL, CL), leave application status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
/payroll	View salary slips, download salary reports (PDF/Excel).
/admin/employees	Admin dashboard to add/update employee profiles, working days, holidays.
/admin/settings	Admin panel to configure leave policies, payroll settings, and attendance rules.
/reports	Display reports like attendance summary, overtime tracking, salary disbursement reports using charts.
/future-modules	Placeholder for Phase 2 modules (Task Management, Expense Claims, Feedback & Appraisal, Onboarding & Exit). Grey out modules that are not yet active.
5. Role-Based Access Control:


Role	Permissions
Admin	Full access to everything (create, read, update, delete all modules)
HR	Manage attendance, approve/reject leaves, view/edit department employees.
Employee	Self clock-in/out, apply for leave, view salary slip, view personal data.
6. Authentication System:

Use JWT Tokens for secure sessions.

Implement refresh tokens to keep users logged in securely.

Role is stored in the JWT payload and used for page access control.

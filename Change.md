Of recent I was able to change the frontend storage from Drizzle ORM and postgresql to Local Storage and fetching data from the backend.

18th June - 
With the help of the Holy Spirit, today, I was able the issue concerning the authentication. I have been working on the outside server [Backend folder] to fix the authentication issue, turns out that server handling the authentication process is the one inside of the Frontend folder. Was finally able to change that server folder (inside of frontend) from using session-based authentication to JWT.
